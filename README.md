# Supervised-Learning-Classification 
Repository containing Supervised Learning Classification Concepts, Case studies, different classification models and this includes Logistic regression models, ensemble techinque, bagging models & boosting models and stacked models and measuring the performance of the model using various model performace evaluation metrics.

  - ### Supervised Learning Classification

        - [Predicting did the customer accepted the loan offered in the last Campaign or not](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Supervised-Learning-Classification/blob/main/Case%20study%20Classification%20models.ipynb): A model to build that will help the client identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.

        - [Logistic Regression, Decision Tree & Random Forest](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Supervised-Learning-Classification/blob/main/week%2001%20classification.ipynb): This dataset about the prediction of Graduate admissions from an Indian perspective. The dataset contains various features that are important during the application for the Master's Program. The predicted output obtained from the classification algorithm gives a fair idea about the chances of a student for admission.

       - [KNN & Naive Bayes](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Supervised-Learning-Classification/blob/main/week%2002%20KNN%20%26%20Naive%20Baye's.ipynb) : This dataset about the prediction of Graduate admissions from an Indian perspective. In this file I have built KNN and Naive Bayes model and compared the results between them using different various model performance evaluation metrics.

       - [AdaBoost, GradientBoost, XGBoost & Stacking](https://github.com/VikasHM66/Supervised-Learning-Classification/blob/main/week%2002%20AdaBoost%2C%20GradientBoost%2C%20XGBoost%2C%20Stacking.ipynb): In this file I have build models based on Adaboost, GradientBoost, XGBoost and Stacking models and comapared the results between them with various model performance evaluation metrics.
